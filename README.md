# PIDonTIVA

For my simulation, I used the following parameters in my simulink model:
k = 5
b = 5
J = 10

To run, plug in Tiva.  Select "Run"-->"Load"--> "PID".  Once it debugs, compiles, and builds, 
open simulink, set the stop time to 50s, and select "Run".  Then, open scope2 to see the encoder count.
